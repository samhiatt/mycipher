    "1. The KEYSIZE with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably the key. You could proceed perhaps with the smallest 2-3 KEYSIZE values. Or take 4 KEYSIZE blocks instead of 2 and average the distances.\n",
    "1. Now that you probably know the KEYSIZE: break the ciphertext into blocks of KEYSIZE length.\n",

    "1. Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You already have code to do this.\n",
